# VideographyAndEdits
In here are a few videos I shot and edited. I'll update it with each project and they represent my flexibility as a video editor.
I worked on short edits for events such as a weddings, parties, vlogs. I have a fresh and young outlook as well as a good eye for detail, helping me to create and deliver professional content.

I take, edit, color correct and grade both photos and videos, I have genuine passion for capturing in general.

I'm also into product design. Ui/Ux is one of my fortes. By applying my experience in graphic design, I'm able to turn out creative and colorful UI designs
